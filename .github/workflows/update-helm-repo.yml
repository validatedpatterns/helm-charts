# Note this workflow is only maintained in this repo
# It should be invoked from each chart's repo
#
# This invokes the workflow named 'publish-charts' in the umbrella repo
# It expects to have a secret called CHARTS_REPOS_TOKEN which contains
# the GitHub token that has permissions to invoke workflows and commit code
# inside the umbrella-repo.
# The following fine-grained permissions were used in testing and were limited
# to the umbrella repo only:
# - Actions: r/w
# - Commit statuses: r/w
# - Contents: r/w
# - Deployments: r/w
# - Pages: r/w
